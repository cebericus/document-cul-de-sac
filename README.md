=================

Ruby/Rails implementation of a secure web site for distributino of documents to clients.

Note: This code is intended as a code sample.  If you intend to build or deploy the site, you will have to provide the images for the front end (app/views/layouts) and a new "secret_key_base" in the file: secret_token.rb.  The document uploader can be configured to recognize multiple document types by providing an extension and associated icon.
